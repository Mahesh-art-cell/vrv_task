***Project Description***
Log Analysis and Suspicious Activity Detection
This project involves parsing web server log files to analyze various metrics, including the number of requests per IP address, the most frequently accessed endpoint, and detecting suspicious activity (failed login attempts). The results are saved into a CSV file for easy review. The project is designed to help identify potential security threats or performance bottlenecks on a website by analyzing log data.

The primary goal of this project is to:

Parse server logs to gather statistics such as IP address requests, endpoint accesses, and failed login attempts.
Detect suspicious activities, such as brute force attacks or invalid login attempts, by analyzing failed login attempts above a set threshold.
Generate a CSV report that includes the requests per IP, the most accessed endpoint, and suspicious activity detected based on login failures.

***key features***: 
log file parsing
request counting
failed login detection
suspicious activity detection
CSV report generation
